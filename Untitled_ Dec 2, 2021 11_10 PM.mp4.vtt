00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800
Hello.
This is a demo for our visualization

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.620
and for our project, and our project
is called Vaccine Stock Analysis.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.240
So the first thing is we have
two different kinds of charts.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.520
We have a line chart and a bar
chart and the line chart.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.460
I'll start with the line charts.

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.660
The line chart has the ability
to basically look at different values.

7
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.940
So for any given stock,
there's an open or close.

8
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.780
A high alone, adjusted close and adjusted
close accounts for dividends, basically.

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.820
And so you can choose
from any one of these.

10
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.980
If you press on open,
it will automatically change.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.200
If you press on low, it will
automatically change there.

12
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.060
So essentially,
you have that functionality to choose

13
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.180
from any particular value
that you're interested in.

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.540
And from there,
you have the ability to basically examine

15
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.500
the values of each of these lines
just by scrolling over them.

16
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.200
As you can see here, no backs essentially
goes from $212 all the way up to $308.

17
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380
So it's really easy to see that price

18
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.050
change just by scrolling over
and dragging your cursor.

19
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.900
That's kind of what
the line chart is doing.

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.210
We just have the prices right on the X
axis and the relative timescale on the Y

21
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.130
axis going from around
2020 to July of 2021.

22
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.850
As far as the bar chart is concerned,
we're just looking at the average

23
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.140
cumulative volume of each company over
the course of our data set, essentially.

24
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.540
So we can see that it's nicely plotted.

25
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.180
We have our scale, and we
have each of the companies.

26
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.700
And as far as some of the functionality is
for brushing, linking,

27
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.850
and all that is concerned,
we have the ability to press on any

28
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.440
individual bar and get its corresponding
line in black, as you can see if I clicked

29
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.280
on Bio and Tech that's highlighted if I
click on Novax or Nova Vaccine that's

30
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.900
highlighted Johnson and Johnson
and so on and so forth.

31
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.540
Right.

32
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.760
So that's going to be
our linking component.

33
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.180
And then essentially what
we have is our brushing.

34
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.520
As far as our brushing is concerned,

35
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.500
you have the ability to kind
of just brush over, and it will

36
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.480
Consequently highlight

37
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.100
the corresponding line as you can see as I

38
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.380
go across and start brushing
over multiple bars.

39
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.660
Eventually, all the lines
are highlighted in black.

40
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.140
So that's kind of the functionality
that we implemented there.

41
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.820
So that's really nice.
It's easy to see which lines because

42
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.800
the lines are a bit clustered,
but it becomes a lot easier

43
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.360
to look at individual values through

44
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.860
the brushing and linking
facilitated through the bar chart.

45
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.240
So that's pretty much it as far as
the functionality is concerned.

46
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.720
And yeah, so hopefully that was helpful.
